# Datasets

The datasets included in this folder are provided for the convenience of reproducing our analyses.  The citation and source of each dataset is listed in the supplementary tables of our two manuscripts.  All included datasets have been posted to public repositories (FigShare and DataDryad) and are therefore citable.  Not all datasets used in our analyses are included.  Datasets entailing original (raw) data are provided with the consent of the original authors.

PLEASE obtain and cite each dataset appropriately if using it for your own analyses.
