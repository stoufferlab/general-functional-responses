# General Functional Responses
Currently, this repo contains all code (and most data) for reproducing the analyses associated with two manuscripts:
Stouffer & Novak (2020) *Hidden layers of density dependence in consumer feeding rates* (bioRxiv link)
Novak & Stouffer (2020) *Systematic bias in studies of consumer functional responses* (bioRxiv link)

## Organization
The repo is mostly *not* split-up by manuscript because most code pertaining to *"Systematic bias..."* is also used in *"Hidden layers..."*.  Rather, it is primarily split-up by dataset type, distinguishing (1) functional-response datasets entailing variation in the abundance of both a (single) consumer species and its (single) resource species (*"One_Predator_One_Prey"*) from (2) functional-response datasets entailing variation in the abundance of two resources but no variation in the abundance of the consumer (*"One_Predator_Two_Prey"*).

### code
##### Mathematica
Primarily for the calculation of Fisher Information Matrices, derivations of qualitative bias in functional-response parameter MLEs, and derivations of generalized functional response models.
##### R
Contains a library (*lib*) of scripts used in the model-fitting and subsequent analyses of both *One_Predator_One_Prey* and *One_Predator_Two_Prey* datasets.  Within each of the two latter folders, `fit_all_datasets.R` does as implied; otherwise use `RUNME.R` scripts.

### data
Contains all functional response datasets (for which permission for public posting was granted) used in the analyses.  See *data/README.md* and the supplemedatatables in the supplementary materials of our manuscripts for sources and citations.

### results
##### Mathematica
Contains results used to generate Fig. 1 of *"Systematic bias..."*.
##### R
Contains all other results, figures and tables.

# Warranty
All code is provided "as is" and without warranty.  If you know of more efficient or elegant ways of doing anything (of which there are likely many), weâ€™d love to learn from you.
