# General Functional Responses
This repository (tag [ELE.2021.a.b](https://github.com/stoufferlab/general-functional-responses/tree/ELE.2021.a.b)) contains all code and most data for reproducing the analyses associated with two publications:

Stouffer & Novak (2021) *Hidden layers of density dependence in consumer feeding rates.* [Ecology Letters](https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.13670) ([bioRxiv](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.25.263806))

Novak & Stouffer (2021) *Systematic bias in studies of consumer functional responses.* [Ecology Letters](https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.13660) ([bioRxiv](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.25.263814))

Of direct relevance to the latter paper is
Novak & Stouffer (2022) *Geometric complexity and the information-theoretic comparison of functional-response models.* [Frontiers in Ecology & Evolution](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.740362/full) ([bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.31.454600v1)), the code for which is on this [Geometric Complexity](https://github.com/marknovak/GeometricComplexity) repository.

Code committed subsequent to [ELE.2021.a.b](https://github.com/stoufferlab/general-functional-responses/tree/ELE.2021.a.b) is work in progress.

Please email Daniel Stouffer (daniel.stouffer@canterbury.ac.nz) or Mark Novak (mark.novak@oregonstate.edu) with any questions.

## Organization
The repository is mostly *not* split-up by publication because most code pertaining to *"Systematic bias..."* is also used in *"Hidden layers..."*.  Rather, it is primarily split-up by dataset type, distinguishing (1) functional-response datasets entailing variation in the abundance of both a (single) consumer species and its (single) resource species (*"One_Predator_One_Prey"*) from (2) functional-response datasets entailing variation in the abundance of two resources but no variation in the abundance of the consumer (*"One_Predator_Two_Prey"*).

### [code](code/)
##### [Mathematica](code/Mathematica)
Primarily for the calculation of Fisher Information Matrices, derivations of qualitative bias in functional-response parameter MLEs, and derivations of generalized functional-response models.
##### [R](code/R)
Contains a [library of scripts](code/R/lib) used in the model-fitting and subsequent analyses of both *One_Predator_One_Prey* and *One_Predator_Two_Prey* datasets.  Within each of the two latter folders, `fit_all_datasets.R` does as implied; otherwise use `RUNME.R` scripts.

### [data](data)
Contains all functional-response datasets (for which permission for public posting was granted) used in the analyses.  See [data/README.md](data/README.md) and the supplementary data tables in the supplementary materials of the publications for sources and citations.

### [results](results)
##### [Mathematica](results/Mathematica)
Contains results used to generate Fig. 1 of *"Systematic bias..."*.
##### [R](results/R)
Contains all other results, figures and tables.

# Warranty
All code is provided "as is" and without warranty.  If you know of more efficient or elegant ways of doing anything (of which there are likely many), weâ€™d love to learn from you.
